# Horizon (Planning Stage)

## Project Description
A high precision experimental bicopter with customized control system. 
 
## Research Hypothisis
A bicopter design when implemented using an unstable thrust to center of mass point can perform with equivalent mobility to that of the simlified quadcopter version through the use of an advanced control system. 

## Evaluation Criteria
To test this theory I purposely design an unstable thrust/weight configuration to enhance reactibility/mobility of the traditional bicopter configuration to avoid the added requirement of pitch control and improve overall efficiency.

## Todo List
- [ ] Perform Literature Review
- [ ] Identify Key Varriables
- [ ] Create Mathematical Model
- [ ] Perform Model Simulations
- [ ] Fabricate a Design Prototype
